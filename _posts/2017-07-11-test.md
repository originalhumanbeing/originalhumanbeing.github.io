(using a `dl`, so that `Level -> "Master"`, `Keywords -> ul`, ...)

There's many more minor changes and fixes that you can read below.

## Patch Notes
### Minor
* Added "Other Projects" section to the bottom of the project layout (similar to "Related Posts")
* Added CSS classes that make viewing larger (data-) tables possible
* Added section on tables to [docs/writing][writing]
* Reduced use of `<hr/>` elements, using CSS borders instead.
* Improved semantic HTML of resume
* Follow favicon best practices and include example icons
* Added `no_google_fonts` option

### Design
* Reduced number of horizontal lines, making many layouts feel less "cluttered" (esp. `blog` layout)
* Made link hover styles consistent across the board
* Visually separated `thead` and `tbody` and `tfoot` within tables.
* Changed RSS and email icons
* Removed top margin for consecutive headings, e.g. when using `h3` immediately after `h2`.

### Fixes
* Fixed bug that caused inline math to be moved to the end of a paragraph when dynamically loading a page.
* Fixed bug that caused layout to break in IE11.
* Fixed bug that caused the project animation to "jump" when using long project titles.
* No more empty attributes on `img` tags.
